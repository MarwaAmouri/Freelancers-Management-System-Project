# Freelancers-Management-System-Project

Objective: The objective of this project is to create a simple freelancers management system using React. The system will allow the creation of two types of users: clients and contractors. Clients will have the ability to send money to contractors, mimicking the functionality of popular platforms like Upwork.
Functional Requirements:
User Registration and Management:
The system shall provide user registration functionality.
Users can register as either "clients" or "contractors."
Each user registration shall include at least the following information:
Full Name
Email Address
Password
Users shall be able to log in and log out of the system.
User Profiles:
Users shall have individual profiles displaying their name and account balance.
Clients' profiles shall display their current balance and the option to send money to contractors.
Transaction Functionality:
Clients shall be able to send money to contractors.
The system shall ensure that a client's balance is sufficient for the transaction.
Transactions shall record the sender, recipient, and transaction amount.
Contractors shall receive the transferred money and see it reflected in their account balance.
Dashboard:
Users shall have access to a dashboard upon logging in.
The dashboard shall display the user's profile information and account balance.
Non-Functional Requirements:
User Experience:
The system shall provide a user-friendly and responsive user interface.
User actions (e.g., sending money) shall trigger immediate feedback.
Constraints:
The project shall be implemented using the React framework for the front end.
There is no requirement for user authentication via third-party services or social media accounts.
The project will not include a backend system for user management or data storage. Data may be stored locally or simulated for demonstration purposes.
Assumptions:
The project assumes that user authentication and authorization will be managed solely on the front end for demonstration purposes.
The project does not require integration with real payment systems but simulates money transfers within the application.
Acceptance Criteria:
Users can successfully register and log in as clients or contractors.
Clients can view their profile, check their account balance, and send money to contractors.
Contractors can view their profile and see the received payments reflected in their balance.
The system provides immediate feedback to users when sending money or performing other actions.
The user interface is responsive, user-friendly, and visually appealing.
